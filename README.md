## 🦊 Github Footprint

I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. As a proponent of open source, I also shares most of my work online for the reference of others. I hopes that others might find the work useful and will do greater things with them. The following metrics are a testament to that effort.

![Github Metrics](/metrics/metrics.plugin.base.svg)


## 🦊 Github Performance

I do my best to keep a healthy work-life balance. Since I'm working full-time as a software engineer, I sometimes find it hard to keep all other aspects of my life in balance which sometimes results in a decline in Github activity. However, I do my best to keep this balance and not disrupt the flow.

## 🦊 Github Achievements
With the free time I have, I always try to do something valuable for myself and others. The content I upload to GitHub has allowed me to achieve quite a lot within a very small amount of time. These small achievements make me motivated to continue expanding my skillset and to share more and more with others on the internet. The hope is that I'm able to continue this throughout my journey as an engineer. Check out some of the achievements below.

## 🦊 Key Languages

I'm interested in a variety of fields. I find myself comfortable mostly in embedded development. However, I'm interested in scripting, hardware development, and creative design as well. On the other hand, I also do reverse engineering, technology research and blogging. Even though not my strong point, I'm also capable of working on web development. Go through the following to get a better understanding of my skill set.

## 🦊 Highlight Projects

These are some of the projects that I'm proud of. I put a lot of effort into them since they can improve my knowledge of certain technologies while acting as a starting point for others to build great things. I plan to add more projects to this list and to continue developing these even further.

### 01. 💻 Eight Bit Computer Using FPGA
This project is trying to recreate the eight-bit computer that [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater) created in his famous YouTube[ series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU). However, the difference is that here, the intended use is of FPGAs and the Verilog HDL for this task. The goal was to use this as a learning opportunity to sharpen the knowledge in FPGAs and Verilog.
- *Key Technologies* - 𓇲 Verilog | 𓇲 HDL
- *Status* - 🔄 working
- *Repository* - [eight_bit_computer](https://github.com/asankaSovis/eight_bit_computer)

### 02. 🔐 Muragala Password Manager
The goal of this project is to create a safe yet simple password manager that is easy to use. With this goal in mind, both a Python CLI, a C# library as well and a C# CLI application is created. Working is also currently on the way on a GUI application based on the C# library. These projects will also continue to improve and more functionalities will also be added in the future.
- *Key Technologies* - 🐍 Python | 🖥️ Visual C#
- *Status* - 🔄 working

### 03. 🔥 Prometheus Fire Alarm System
This project was intended to create a next-generation fire alarm system that is both robust and smart. It can successfully detect and even extinguish fires while also giving full control to the operator remotely. The command panel even can manage multiple of these fire alarm modules which gives the building much better safety when it comes to fire hazards. I have even uploaded a demonstration to YouTube that shows the fire alarm system in action.

### 04. 📩 BitStreamer
BitStreamer is a data streaming software developed for communication engineers to send a bit stream from one COM port and check how many bits can be received back from another COM port. Here, the bitstream from the first COM port can be sent through a communication medium to check the efficiency of the communication medium.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C++ | 🖥️ Visual C# | ♾️ Arduino
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [BitStreamer](https://github.com/asankaSovis/BitStreamer)

### 05. 📚 Project Akaradiya
Building a database of Sinhala definitions for an English dictionary using crowd-sourcing. Anyone can create an account using their email. They can later add words to the dictionary, add definitions to the existing words, and vote for the best definition from currently existing definitions that others have added.
- *Key Technologies* - ⌨️ JavaScript | 📱 HTML | 🐘 PHP | 🎨 CSS
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [Project-Akaradiya](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Project-Akaradiya)

### 06. 📌 Indoor Positioning System
The idea of this project is to build a system that uses the existing lights to detect the location of a user within an indoor environment. For this, we can use Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology. The basic concept is to have four LEDs transmitting their IDs one after the other at fixed intervals. The receiver can receive the IDs identify how the intensity differs between each LED and decide its position within an environment.

- *Status* - ✅ done (Documenting...)
- *Repository* - [Position_Detection](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Position_Detection)

### 07. 🚘 Metroparking
The main problem identified for this project is the inefficiency of parking implementations. Metro parking is a next-level smart parking system that automates the process of reserving, paying and managing parking services in urban parking providers. It is an IoT-based project that uses electronics, and autonomous and cloud technologies to create a fully automated system to handle parking.

- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [Metroparking](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Metroparking)

### 08. 📡 Bidirectional Transciever
This project was intended to develop a bidirectional transmitter and receiver device that uses Visible Light Communication (VLC) technology to transmit and receive data from one device to another. In its basic form, data is transmitted as pulses of light where on means bit 1 and off means bit 0. This can be paired with more complicated transmitting techniques to build much more accurate and sophisticated data transmission.
- *Key Technologies* - 𓇲 Verilog | 💿 C/C++
- *Status* - ✅ done (Documenting...)
- *Repository* - [Bidirectional_Transmitter](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Bidirectional_Transmitter)

### 09. 🤖 Project Bionic
Project Bionics intends to build a bio-inspired robot that can mimic nature. The design, based on the 3D models shared by KILIC on PCBWay, can mimic the movement of a spider by using servos. The complete system is controlled by a NodeMCU and is powered by a Li-ion battery which makes it portable. The robot can move to the front and back and can rotate to the left and right.
- *Key Technologies* - 💿 C/C++
- *Status* - ✅ done
- *Repository* - [Project_Bionic](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Project_Bionic)

### 10. 📒 Stick It!
Stick It! is a basic note-organizing app that can be used to store and pin notes to the screen. Similar to the Microsoft Sticky Notes, this can be used to write simple notes quickly and easily. Unlike Sticky Notes, this supports markdown and also has the functionality to pin the notes on top of other windows.
- *Key Technologies* - 🖥️ Visual C#
- *Status* - ✅ done (Documenting and Improving...)
- *Repository* - [Stick It!](https://github.com/asankaSovis/Stick-It)

### 11. 🌃 Project Almanac
In this project, the plan was to use a distributed HPC algorithm to enhance timetable scheduling. Since efficiently distributing events across a timetable is an important part of the world to efficiently manage our day-to-day tasks, this project is crucial for the future of efficient timetable allocation. With the use of HPC, we intend to increase efficiency and find the optimal solution to this problem.

### 12. 🌡️ Project Lihini
Founder and developer of Project Lihini. Project Lihini is a project aiming towards building an opensource, end to end weather monitoring platform. The aim is to build a weather monitoring platform that sources data from volunteers and makes the data available publicly. Everything from hardware to software is intended to be opensource. This includes the hardware designs, firmware and web front-end and back-end.
